<h1>Hello Triangle using GLFW</h1>

<p>This is a basic template for using <a href="http://www.glfw.org/">GLFW</a> over Windows. The projects was generated over Visual Studio 2012, using the DLL library of GLFW (instead the static version) and the 32-bit library (instead the 64 bit version) and in Windows 8 (that really doesn't matter, but it was my platform).</p>
<p>The project contains the basic draw, keyboard, initialize and resize function such as GLUT. Also, contains the definition of GLFW_DLL and the usage of <code>#pragma comment</code>.</p>
<p>Functions and variables related to GLFW are encapsulated into a namespace called <code>glfwFunc</code> (nothing special about the name).</p>
